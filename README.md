# Module 3 Challenge - Random Password Generator

## Description

Added functionality to the Random Password Generator interface to accept a password length, and character types specified by the user following a series of prompts and confirmations to the screen. After this, the user-input is validated for the password length and character types. This ensure that the password length is between 8 and 128 characters, as well as ensuring that the user selects at least one special character to be included in the password generation. If the input is invalid, the user will recieve alerts to the screen and will be asked to refresh the page and try again. Once the input is valid, the random password will be generated based off of the selected criteria and returned to the screen for use.
